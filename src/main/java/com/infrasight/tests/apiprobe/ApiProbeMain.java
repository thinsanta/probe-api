     * Arbetsformedligen REST API documentation: https://jobtechdev.se/swagger
     *
     * The County and Office Java classes have several fields that need data.
     * The task at hand is to use the API to fill in the fields for Skane lan (county).
     * You will need to use several of the API endpoints to fill all fields.
     *
     * You may retrieve the data and populate the classes in any way you like.
     *
     * Use any open source libraries you like to complete the task.
     * For example, there are several libraries for JSON processing:
     * Jackson, Google Gson, Org.JSON.
     *
     * It is recommended to use Maven for library dependencies.
     *
     * As a final step, print out the County object with the fields filled in.
